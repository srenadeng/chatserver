# Homework 7

chatserver/client homework for CS3157 Advanced Programming, Spring 2023. 

We created a chat client that communicates with a server via TCP socket. Through the terminal, users are able to connect by entering a unique username and send and receive messages to/from anybody else who is in the "room." 

# Usage
In one window, run
./chatserver <port-number>

In another, run
./chatclient 127.0.0.1 <port-number>
